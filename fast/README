OVERVIEW

This directory contains a fast C implementation of the given problem on how to
count how many rounds it would take to get a deck of cards back to its original
configuration using the following rules:

      1. Take the top card off the deck and set it on the table, face down.
      2. Take the next card off the top and put it on the bottom of the deck in your hand.
      3. Continue steps 1 and 2 until all cards are on the table. This is a round.
      4. Pick up the deck from the table and repeat steps 1-3 until the deck is in the original order.

The solution treats a deck of cards first as a permutation (a bijection from a
set onto itself). The first step in the problem is to map the given algorithm
(steps 1-3) into the actual permutation. This is done by the create_permutation
function.

Once the permutation has been calculated for a given number of elements (say n),
we then turn the permutation into a cycle representation. This is done by the
find_cycles function. The algorithm is based on the Cycle-Sort.

Once all the cycles have been found we can use the insight that each cycle
represents the sequence of steps an element will move from its original position
to its subsequent positions. In order to get the deck back to its original form
we will need each cycle to run a multiple of its size. Since there can be
potentially multiple cycles all of differnt sizes, we must instead calculate
the least common multiplier amongst all the cycles. This will represent the
number of rounds it will take to get a deck of size n back to its original
configuration.

The rest of the code does this lcm calculation using some gcd code.

This program can solve the solution for n = 313 very quickly.

It will take 1575169365 rounds to get a deck of 313 cards to get back to its
original configuration.

BUILD

To build the check_deck, you need to have clang or gcc installed. Run the "make"
command to generate the executable.

EXECUTION

At the command prompt, type "./check_deck <cards>", where cards represents
an integer value for the size of the deck of cards.
